General Info
-------

This plugin was adopted by Iulius and is based on the JBAR-Chrome plugin by rikai.

In short, the plugin applies affiliate codes to the relevant urls of a user that has chosen to use this plugin. However it does not replace any previously attached affiliate tags, the plugin's honoring the user's choice if he clicked on a different affiliate link.
